# Exploratory Testing Prompts

## 1. Exploratory Testing Session Plan

```
Create an exploratory testing session plan for:

Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]
Time Box: [DURATION]
Focus Areas: [AREAS_TO_EXPLORE]
Known Risks: [RISKS]

Generate:
- Testing charter
- Areas to explore
- Questions to answer
- Heuristics to apply
- Note-taking template
- Session goals
```

## 2. Exploratory Testing Heuristics

```
Suggest exploratory testing heuristics for:

Application Type: [WEB/MOBILE/API/DESKTOP]
Feature: [FEATURE_NAME]
User Personas: [DESCRIBE_USERS]

Provide:
- Testing heuristics to apply
- Areas often overlooked
- Common failure patterns
- User behavior scenarios
- Edge cases to explore
```

## 3. Session-Based Test Management

```
Help me structure session-based exploratory testing for:

Project: [PROJECT_NAME]
Team Size: [NUMBER]
Sprint Duration: [WEEKS]
Features to Test: [LIST_FEATURES]

Create:
- Session charter template
- Time-boxing strategy
- Debriefing questions
- Metrics to track
- Reporting format
```

## Best Practices

1. **Charter-Based**: Define clear session charters
2. **Time-Boxed**: Limit sessions to 60-90 minutes
3. **Note-Taking**: Document findings in real-time
4. **Pair Testing**: Explore with another tester
5. **Diverse Approaches**: Use different testing heuristics
6. **Debrief**: Review findings after each session
