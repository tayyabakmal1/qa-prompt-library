### Impact
- **High (3)**: Severe impact on project success
- **Medium (2)**: Moderate impact, manageable
- **Low (1)**: Minor impact, easily handled

### Risk Score

- **Medium Risk**: Score 3-4 (Plan mitigation)
- **Low Risk**: Score 1-2 (Monitor)

## Best Practices

1. **Early Identification**: Identify risks as early as possible
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Regularly review and update risk status
